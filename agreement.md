# Intro

Open Ownership is a concept based on open source. Open source has a couple major advantages. The major advantage being the flexibility of contributions - contributors, as users, can focus on what they believe are the most important features. This is a much more efficient process than market research. Second, contributors can work at their own pace without feeling coerced. Finally, successful open source projects grow communities of developers who can take personal ownership over their product and advocate for it. 

The problem with open source, obviously, is that most open source developers are not fairly compensated for their work - even if their project is useful and ends up making others a lot of money. This means open source projects tend to be under-resourced unless they’re a component of a larger company’s tech stack - and then they serve the needs of that company. 

Open Ownership aims to provide a fair open contract with the goal of allowing flexible contributions to a project and compensating developers for their time. The long term goal of an Open Ownership company is to make money for its shareholders, just the same as a regular company, but the majority of shareholders will always be contributors to the project. Another major goal of an Open Ownership is that it be fundable. A limited number of shares can be sold to VCs. 

Tentative rules for open ownership are as follows:

1. **Work is compensated with shares by hours worked**

	1a. If a contributor’s work is accepted into the project, whether that’s by other contributors merging their pull requests or otherwise incorporating the product of their labor, or by the contributor performing a service such as managing a team, they submit a report of hours worked. This could be a line in a spreadsheet, or the project may employ dedicated software.

	1b. Contributors may negotiate different ‘Rates’ or multipliers for their share income. This allows people of different skill levels to be compensated fairly. These Rates should be agreed upon when a contributor joins the project, and ideally would change infrequently, on the order of a year or so.

	1c. Leaving the Company - Contributors may stop contributing at any time. They won’t gain or lose any more shares and will still retain voting power and any dividends.

	1d. Shareholders may vote to stop accepting contributions from particular Contributors at any time. This won’t affect shares they already earned. Shareholders may also delegate this power to particular Contributors.

	1e. Contributors can only sell their shares back to the Company. Contributor shares can’t be transferred. Any outside agreement that delegates voting rights of a Contributor to another entity violates this agreement and will result in loss of voting rights by that Contributor, including retroactively.

	1f. Contributors may hire their own employees to make contributions, but they must be upfront about this, the number and skill level of employees and re-negotiate their Rate to encompass their entire organization whenever the organization changes. They will receive shares based on hours worked by the entire organization.

	1g. To encourage sustainable work habits, any contributor will not receive more than 50 hours worth of shares in any week. It’s up to the contributor to make sure they don’t apply for more shares than this, and if they receive any extra shares as a result of an oversight they will be returned to the company without compensation upon discovery. 
 
2. **Contributors agree to assign ownership of all Intellectual Property to the Company**

	2a. This includes but is not limited to trade secrets, inventions, patents, and copyright of all submitted work, trademarks associated with the work, and ideas. 
 
	2b. Contributors agree not to submit any work if they don’t have the right to assign it to the company. The at-fault contributor may be held wholly responsible for compensating the company for any damages arising from violating this clause.

	2c. If a Contributor sets up a hired Service that is to be consumed by the Company entirely in their own time, doesn’t receive shares for the work and develops it without any Company property, they must still provide the Company with an unlimited perpetual license for this Service for free. Any exceptions to this clause must be voted on by shareholders in advance of the Contributor receiving any of their shares.

	2d. In summary, it violates this agreement to do work for the Company under this agreement and then use that work to extort the Company for more money. If a Contributor does work for the company, the Company owns ALL related work in exchange for the shares the Contributor receives.

3. **Company operations are voted on by Shareholders electronically**

	3a. Rather than having a board of directors that run day to day operations, the Company should be run by shareholders. The shareholders may vote to delegate authority to certain Contributors, but they should be allowed to raise a vote anytime that can be resolved in 24 hours using an online service agreed upon by the Company.

	3b. Whatever service is used for voting, it should have a notification system, and to be valid, any vote should trigger notifications to the shareholders. If a shareholder deliberately turns off their own notifications this won’t invalidate any votes they miss as a result.

	3c. Any vote can be binding if it either receives votes from more than one contributor, or the majority of shares 24 hours after the vote starts. Only cast votes are counted.

	3d. This agreement may be modified only by two thirds majority vote of Contributor shares. Funding shares have no say in modifying this agreement, though they may vote in any other referendum.

	3e. Note that a decision to sell the entire Company counts as modification to this agreement because of rule 1e.

4. **Funding Shares are a separate pool from member shares**

	4a. Up to 40% of the company shares can be sold to fund the company. These shares can be freely transferred. The rest are reserved for compensating Contributors.

	4b. Shares that aren’t issued yet and still owned by the company vote proportionally with the Contributors. This rule means that initial funders won’t immediately own the company if they hold the majority of issued shares - because at least 60% of all shares are reserved for Contributors and will always vote with Contributors. 

	4c. Share dilution should not affect the 60/40 split. Dilution should apply to existing Contributor shares and Funding shares equally. So when new shares are created, 60% of them will be unissued Contributor shares owned by the company, and 40% of them will be unissued funding shares that may be sold. 

	4d. Funding shares may be sold by a shareholder vote, or on a schedule created by shareholder vote.

	4e. Funds from selling stock are the property of the company, and may be spent based on a shareholder vote or by a Contributor shareholders voted to delegate this authority to. 

5. **This is also a non-disclosure agreement**

	5a. Contributors agree not to divulge any future plans, source code, trade secrets, or other Intellectual Property to anyone outside of the Company if the information has been designated as secret by a Contributor. This designation should be in the license file of a repository, or at the top of the document, or in a directory name. 
 
6. **Dispute Resolution**

	6a. Disputes between shareholders should generally be resolved with best faith discussion or through a shareholder vote.

	6b. If neither of those are an option, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration, litigation, or some other dispute resolution procedure.
